## Introduction into I4.0

- Vertical integration and networked production systems
- Horizontal integration via value creation networks 
- seamless engineering over the lifecycle / Consistency of the engineering over the entire life cycle

### I4.0 Steps

- Steps:
    - Computerisation
        - Make normal System digital (preparation for i40)
    - Connectivity
        - Add interfaces 
    - Visibility
        - Make Data and process visible, seeable via databases or so
    - Transparency
    - Predictive Capacity
    - Adaptability
    

## Day 2 - RAMI4.0

### RAMI Model

1. Life Cycle and Value Stream - engineering and management of products and production plant over whole lifecycle
1. Hierarchy Levels - Seamles automation from sensors to business
1. Layers - a shell model for a holistical information exchange

### Words

- Asset: may be a lot, from the cup of coffee to the machine
- RAMI4.0: Reference architecture i4.0
- Instance: model created from a type
- OPCUA - Open Protocol Communication Unified Access

### Road today RealTime

- from Point to Point Comm -> data collection in cloud and processing
- 

## Day 3 - RAMI4.0 - 2

- mastering complex models
    - planning models
    - context : Scope of a system. One can have a completely different context than another

- BPMN: Business Process Modelling Notation
    - stateless description of processes and behaviour

- UML: Unified Modelling Language
- SysML: System Modelling Language - describe software and mechatronical systems [see here](https://i40.fh-aachen.de/intranet/materials/additional/uml/index.html)

- Model Based design:
    - Analysis
    - Design
    - test
    - integration
    - usage
    - (disposal)

- use models to prove results against the models predictions


### Digital Twins

- **Logical representation of a physical asset**

- The digital twin basically is the model of the system you are bulding up
    - no personality, should explain the bahaviour as close as possible
    - physical entity, and a correspinding model of the entity
    - create a digital twin, only if an object has a longer lifespan, if it needs updates, service & co
    - short lifespan models do not need a digital twin!

- Typical usecases fir a digital twin
    - 


### JSON

- Object oriented modeling language
-  

## Day 4 - AI

- widely used today
- GenAI, LLM, ML, ...
- AI appeared around the 1950's, LM in the 80's, ...
