# Potential goals 
-----------------------
- [ ] Improving energy efficiency (Potentially keeping water warm during high times, would decrease time it would take to make coffee)
- [ ] Deep learning algorithm to see which coffee was made and if some coffee was stopped prematurely (failed coffee)
- [ ] Potentially check high times by doing experiments, check in cafeteria when mosed used.
- [ ] Include OEE in final presentation
